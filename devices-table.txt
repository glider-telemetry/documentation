The devices table contains a record for each change done to a tracker config, changes are done via the 'device' messages sent by the tracker.

The Primarykey is the trackerID, the SortKey is the time when the change was done.

The reason to keep the old configs is so we can generate the IGC file for the person who flew the flight. If we have only the last config and someone changes the SD card before the IGC file is generated, the IGC file will generat for the new pilot, not the one that flew.

The trackers ID is the IMEI of the tracker, that is a unique ID of 15-16 digits in formats of:
AA-BBBBBB-CCCCCC-D    (Hardware IMEI)
AA-BBBBBB-CCCCCC-EE   (Software IMEI)

For testing without trackers, will use the range:
10-000000-000000-01  => 10-000000-000000-99

The trackers are not manually registered, when a tracker sends its first "device" message, it is automatically registerd. At that time it will have some empty attributes, like GliderType, GliderID, etc.. Those ID's are updated by the TrackerUI app, sent to the tracker and the tracker send them to the 'devices' table. We never update the devices table via any other mean than the 'device' message from the tracker.

If the TrackertUI app needs to change something we will send a special formated answer on any fix or device message received and the tracker will update and send a new 'device' message.

When the collector receives a 'device' message from the tracker, it will reply with the Pilots Names so they can be displayed on the tracker.

The "privacy" field exists for the Device as well as Pilot, the generation and display of the IGC files or tracking will use the most restrictive value.
