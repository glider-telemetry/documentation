The flights table is the index of the IGC files repositories.

flightID is the name of the IGC file in S3

The table has indexed fields used for common searches and non indexed fields that can be searched via table scans.

There are some challenges about the privacy of the data where people could guess a filename or download an IGC file that is no anonymous, see privacy section for details how we can handle it.

Anonymous levels
0 => All info is present in the flights table
1 => flightID is anonymised using random values after XGA
     TrackerID is ommited
     gliderID is set to Anon
     gliderClass is ommited
     pilot1ID is set to Anon
     pilot2ID is set to Anon
2 => There is no flight record kept nor IGC trace     

When IGC files are first generated, all the indexed fileds we have data for are written. When the advanced IGC analysis is performed, the other fields are updated.
